## Tech Stack
- Java 21
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud
- Spring Cloud Gateway
- Eureka Service Discovery
- Spring Config Server
- Resilience4j
- Maven
- Docker
- REST APIs

Each section introduces new microservices design concepts such as:

- REST microservices communication
- Service discovery
- Centralized configuration
- API Gateway routing
- Rate limiting
- Fault tolerance patterns
- Cloud-ready deployment architecture

## Running a Service

Example:

```bash
cd section_10/cards
mvn spring-boot:run

http://localhost:<service-port>
```

Ports vary based on service configuration.

### Important next step (strong portfolio impact)
After pushing:
1. Upload the architecture diagram into `docs/images/architecture.png`
2. Commit and push
3. Pin this repository on your GitHub profile

This single repository, when pinned with a strong README + architecture diagram, significantly increases backend recruiter engagement because it clearly demonstrates **Spring Cloud distributed systems capability**, which many candidates lack.
